# Ammeter Testing Framework

A configuration-driven Quality-Assurance framework for testing current-measurement
systems built on three ammeter emulators (**Greenlee**, **ENTES**, **CIRCUTOR**).
Each emulator runs as a TCP socket server on its own thread and answers
measurement requests with a current value (Amps). The framework drives all three
through one unified interface, collects timed samples, computes statistics,
visualises and archives every run, and ranks the ammeters by reliability.

---

## Quick Start

```sh
# 1. Install dependencies (see "Libraries" below)
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt        # Windows  (use python3 on Linux/Mac)

# 2. Smoke test - start the emulators and read one measurement from each
py main.py

# 3. Full framework demo - sample, analyse, visualise, archive, compare
py examples/run_tests.py
```

Results are written under `results/` (one folder per run + a `comparison.png`
and `results/logs/`).

> On Windows the Microsoft-Store `python` shim may be a no-op; use the `py`
> launcher as shown. On Linux/Mac use `python3`.

## The Ammeters

| Ammeter  | Port | Command                                   | Method                  | Formula        |
|----------|------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Greenlee | 5000 | `MEASURE_GREENLEE -get_measurement`       | Ohm's Law               | `I = V / R`    |
| ENTES    | 5001 | `MEASURE_ENTES -get_data`                 | Hall Effect             | `I = B * K`    |
| CIRCUTOR | 5002 | `MEASURE_CIRCUTOR -get_measurement -current` | Rogowski Coil        | `I = Σ(V·dt)`  |

Ports and commands are defined once in `config/config.yaml` and used everywhere.

## What the Framework Does (mapped to the exercise)

1. **Unified Measurement API** — `AmmeterTestFramework.run_test(ammeter_type)` drives
   any ammeter; `run_all()` runs them all. Adding a new ammeter is a config-only change.
2. **Measurement Sampling** — configurable `measurements_count`, `total_duration_seconds`
   and `sampling_frequency_hz`. The sampler reconciles these (over-determined) knobs with
   a documented precedence and paces samples on a monotonic clock for accurate timing.
3. **Result Analysis** — mean, median, std-dev, min, max, range, and coefficient of
   variation, plus sampling-cadence consistency (jitter).
4. **Result Management** — every run gets a unique id and is archived to
   `results/<timestamp>_<ammeter>_<id>/result.json` with full metadata; `result.py`
   provides load/list helpers for historical retrieval and comparison.
5. **Accuracy / Reliability Assessment (bonus)** — ranks ammeters by coefficient of
   variation and identifies the most reliable measurement method.

**Bonus features implemented:** visualization (histogram, time-series, comparison
box-plot), error simulation, cross-ammeter accuracy comparison, and a fully
configuration-driven design.

## Configuration

Everything is controlled from `config/config.yaml`:

- `ammeters` — name → `port` + `command` (add a 4th here with no code changes).
- `testing.sampling` — `measurements_count`, `total_duration_seconds`, `sampling_frequency_hz`
  (set any to `null` to derive it from the others).
- `testing.connection` — host, per-request `timeout_seconds`, `retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`.
- `analysis` — which metrics, which plots, whether to run the accuracy comparison.
- `error_simulation` — `enabled`, `drop_rate`, `corrupt_rate` (bonus).
- `result_management` — `output_dir`, `save_raw_samples`.

## Bug Fixes Applied (required by the exercise)

The provided code could not run. The following were fixed; each is a minimal change
to the existing infrastructure:

1. **`main.py` did nothing** — the request lines were commented out, used the wrong
   (incomplete) commands (e.g. `b'MEASURE_GREENLEE'` instead of the full
   `MEASURE_GREENLEE -get_measurement` the server requires for its exact-match check),
   and relied on a fixed `time.sleep`. Rewritten to start the emulators via
   `EmulatorManager` and request from each using the exact commands from config.

2. **Port mismatch** — README said 5000/5001/5002 but `main.py` used 5001/5002/5003.
   Unified to 5000/5001/5002, now sourced from `config.yaml` so they can never drift.

3. **CIRCUTOR command mismatch** — the README listed `MEASURE_CIRCUTOR -get_measurement`
   but the emulator requires `MEASURE_CIRCUTOR -get_measurement -current`. Config now
   carries the exact byte-string the emulator checks against.

4. **`client.py` returned `None`** — it only *printed* the measurement, so it could not
   be consumed programmatically. Added `get_current_measurement(...)` which returns a
   `float` (with a socket timeout) and kept the original print helper as a thin wrapper.

5. **Greenlee `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows** — `Greenlee_Ammeter.measure_current`
   printed the `Ω` symbol, which crashes on the Windows console (cp1252) and silently
   killed the Greenlee server thread (it returned "no data"). Replaced `Ω` with `Ohm`
   for cross-platform safety.

6. **"Address already in use" on restart** — `base_ammeter.start_server` did not set
   `SO_REUSEADDR` (the README hinted at this with the "increase sleep time" note). Added
   `SO_REUSEADDR` so emulators rebind cleanly between runs.

7. **Empty stubs** — `src/testing/test_framework.py` (a `pass` stub), `config/config.yaml`
   (all `NULL`), and `src/utils/logger.py` (created a logger but never attached a handler,
   so nothing was logged) were all implemented. `examples/run_tests.py` also called
   `run_test()` with no argument against a signature that required one — fixed.

8. **Missing package markers** — added `__init__.py` to `Ammeters/`, `src/`,
   `src/utils/`, `src/testing/` so the relative/absolute imports resolve reliably.

## Sample Results

A representative run is committed under `results/`. Each run folder contains:

- `result.json` — full record: run id, config snapshot, raw samples, statistics, metadata.
- `histogram.png` — distribution of measured current.
- `time_series.png` — current vs. time.

Plus a top-level `results/comparison.png` (box-plot across ammeters) and per-run logs
under `results/logs/`.

Because the emulators return random values within fixed physical ranges, CIRCUTOR and
ENTES are typically the most "reliable" (lowest coefficient of variation) while
Greenlee — whose `I = V/R` spans values near small resistances — shows the widest spread.
